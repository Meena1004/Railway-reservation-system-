The Railway Reservation System is a frontend-only web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to search for trains, select seats, and simulate a payment process. Booking details are stored in localStorage for viewing after payment. The system also features a simple user interface for booking and confirming tickets.
